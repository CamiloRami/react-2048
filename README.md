# React 2048
This project is a new version of the popular game 2048, built with React and Tailwind CSS. It uses the local storage to save the game state, so you can close the browser and come back later to continue playing.  
You can play the game [here](https://react-2048-nine.vercel.app/).

## How to run the project
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to serve the project
4. Run `npm run build` to create a production build

## How to play
Use the arrow keys to move the tiles (if you are using a touch screen, you can swipe in the desired direction). When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!  
Only you lose when there are no more moves available.  
If you get to the 2048 tile, you win! though you can keep playing to get a higher score.
